This repository includes Python programs that provide solutions to two (2) problems from Program Assignment 4: Data Wrangling and Data Visualization.

---
## PROBLEM 1
**Problem:** Create the following data frames based on the format provided: Example: Vis = [“Name”, “Gender”, “Track”, “Math<70”]; hometown is constant as Visayas <br>
a. Filename: Instru = [“Name”, “GEAS”, “Electronics >70”]; where track is constant as Instrumentation and hometown Luzon <br>
**Code Process:**
1. The program creates a new DataFrame Instru by filtering the board DataFrame with multiple conditions:
   * The value of Track must be Instrumentation.
   * The value of Hometown must be Luzon.
   * The value of Electronics must be greater than 70.
2. After applying these filters using the & operator, only the columns Name, GEAS, and Electronics are selected.
3. The resulting subset is stored in the DataFrame Instru.
4. To improve clarity, the program renames the Electronics column to Electronics >70.
5. Finally, the Instru DataFrame is displayed, showing the filtered results.
